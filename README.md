The AI virtual mouse project aims to develop a sophisticated computer interface that replaces traditional physical mouse with an artificial intelligence-driven virtual equivalent. This project utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to develop a gesture control system. The system employs the MediaPipe library for hand tracking, recognizing various hand gestures in real-time. This innovative approach enhances accessibility, eliminates the need for hardware peripherals, and opens up new possibilities for responsive human-computer interaction. The recognized gestures trigger different actions like cursor movement, left click, right click, drag and drop, double click, brightness control, volume control, scroll etc enabling hands-free control of a computer.This gesture control system can find applications in fields such as human-computer interaction, accessibility, and user interface design, providing an alternative and interactive means of controlling computers and devices.
